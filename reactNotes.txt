- ReactJs is a javascript library created by Facebook(meta). 
- It is going to handle development of single-page development.
- It updates DOM in much faster way by using reconciliation algorithm. It also uses routing mechanism and navigates through multiple pages and instead 
    of updating whole page. It will update only DOM which is modified.(rendering of particular element instead of whole page)
- It has loosely coupled code.
- Virtual DOM - it is created by reactjs instead of using DOM it will use virtual DOM for user interactions as it is faster and easier. It gets 
    reference of the actual DOM and updates those nodes in the virtual DOM and later updates internally.
- React elements are immutable.

- It has Components structure 
    - it has 3 types of components
        - functional components (uses functions)
        - class components (create classes)
        - higher order components (reusable logic)

- It props and state 
    - props - it is the data passed from the parent component and these are read-only.
    - state - it is a object inside the component and these are mutable. basically it is a local storage.

- when you get the props, destructure them and then use inside a child component.
- state can be used be created using context API or by importing redux and creating store.

- Props drilling - when the props are passed from one component to multiple components inorder to pass the data from one to another component. 
    to avoid this state was created.

- state can set using this.setState() and can be read by this.state.value. we will have constructor to definite the inital state.

- life cycle methods of components
    - mount,update and unmount
    - functional components life cycle methods are called as hooks.
    - these are used to identify how the class is being loaded.
    - few methods are
        - to load component
            - constructor() 
            - static getDerivedStateFromProps()- deriving props if available or gives the default props
            - render() - will render jsx to DOM
            - componentDidMount() - checks whether component is utilized and loaded into DOM.
        - updating change 
            - shouldUpdate() - it is a boolean whether to update or not
            - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() - get the current situation before update.
            - componentDidUpdate() - checks updated or not
        - to unload
            - componentWillUnmount() - to remove from DOM
        - error handling 
            -  static getStateFromError()
            - componentDidCatch()
